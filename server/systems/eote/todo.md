# Edge of the Empire / Genesys System ToDo

This system is a little odd in that we've actually got two systems in one here, and they both have their own list of
things that need to be finished. I'm going to focus on `Genesys`, because that's what I'm playing, even though it's  
`Edge of the Empire` that I need to have done to replace the main site. Ah, well.
